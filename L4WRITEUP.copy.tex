 The aim of this report is to extract a value of the strong coupling constant ${\alpha_s}$. The extraction is presented at Next-to-Leading Order and other methods of extraction with different sensitivities are discussed. The fundamentals of Quantum Chromodynamics are discussed including colour confinement and asymptotic freedom of ${\alpha_s}$. This required the need for discussing factorisation and renormalisation scales, and the practical implications this had during the extraction. A ${\chi^2}$  fit was performed in order to extract ${\alpha_s}$. Covariance matrices are calculated using PDF'S generated from predictions from BLACKHAT+SHERPA, and experimental ${Z}$+ 2,3,4 jets data generated by ATLAS at CERN.  The value obtained was ${\alpha_s(M_Z) = **** \pm ^{//}_{//}}$.

\section{Introduction} 


The strong coupling constant ${\alpha _s}$ determines the magnitude of an interaction between particles with colour charge; quarks and gluons \cite{PPB}. It cannot be predicted from first principles, so must be extracted from experiments, and is a parameter of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) \cite{DMP}.  ${\alpha _s}$ is obtained by considering the cross-section of a collision event of two protons, the data of which is collected by ATLAS at CERN \cite{HEPD}. The data is measured at a centre of mass  energy of ${s = \sqrt{13}}$ TeV for multiple jet processes \cite{HEPP}.  Protons are hadrons which are composed of partons, namely quarks and gluons, this means their centre of mass energy is not fixed, thus a huge spectrum of energies can be considered. The partons are charged under the strong force and they emit vast amounts of radiation, which gives rise to jets \cite{PHD}. Jets are a collimated spray of hadrons. Jets of ${Z}$ boson + 2,3,4 differential cross section are used to extract ${\alpha _s}$ \cite{HEPP}. A jet is generated due to energetic gluons forming hadrons. Previous values of ${\alpha _s}$ have been extracted using similar methods and yielded a value of ${\alpha _s(M_z) = 0.1178^{+0.0051}_{-0.0043}}$ at a centre of mass energy of ${s=\sqrt{7}}$  TeV, where ${M_Z}$ is the mass of the ${Z}$ boson. The world average is given as ${\alpha _s(M_z) = 0.1181 \pm 0.0011}$ \cite{PPB}. ${\alpha _s}$ is extracted by comparing this experimental data to theoretical data generated using parton distribution functions, (PDF). This then enabled us to perform a ${\chi^2}$ test, see Section (\ref{stats}). PDF's are probability density functions and describe the probabilities of finding certain partons, inside the proton. The total momentum carried by the partons inside the proton must equal 1 as the PDF's are normalised \cite{BOOK}. PDF's cannot be calculated from first principles and they must be generated using Monte-Carlo simulations. The PDF's are generated using predictions from BLACKHAT+SHERPA which is a Monte-Carlo simulation \cite{BLACK}. Monte-Carlo simulations are computational algorithms that simulate events and generate data, and hence can be used to generate theoretical predictions of ${\alpha _s}$ \cite{MONTE}. It is often useful to calculate the computationally intensive parts which in this case are the matrix elements and the phase-space information, which can be re-read and re-used for future use for different PDF's etc \cite{BLACK}. The value of ${\alpha _s}$ presented here is at next-to-leading order (NLO). NLO specifically means for a number of jets $j$, the observable, ${\mathcal{O}}$, depends on ${\alpha _s}$ as: \begin{equation} \label{expan} \mathcal{O} \propto \alpha _s^j (1 + \alpha_c), \end{equation} where ${\alpha _c}$ is a correction term. In equation (\ref{expan}) ${\alpha _s}$ is expanded using perturbation theory thus has different orders of sensitivity depending on the jet number. A larger number of jets corresponds to a higher theoretical and experimental uncertainty. This is because a higher energy is required for larger jets so they are less likely to occur, thus less data, and hence a larger uncertainty. A higher number of jets is also more difficult to simulate in Monte-Carlo simulations. However as the jet number increases so does the order of ${\alpha_s}$ according to equation (\ref{expan}), which means there is an increase in sensitivity. Thus the increased uncertainty is somewhat compensated for. Hence the degrees of precision for each number of jets can be compared so the best method for extraction is to combine the 3 multiplicities to find a final value of ${\alpha _s}$ \cite{DMP}. 

Previously a similar method for extracting ${\alpha_s}$ was used at a centre of mass energy ${s = \sqrt{7}}$ TeV, compared to this extraction at ${s = \sqrt{13}}$ TeV. The advantage of the increase in ${s}$ is such that it increases the production cross section, which essentially increases the number of scattering events which generates more data also. At higher energies, it is more likely that more jets are produced, thus more data can be obtained at these higher multiplicities. This reduces the experimental uncertainty and thus the overall uncertainty in the extraction of ${\alpha_s}$. 

There are many different methods for extracting ${\alpha_s}$, each with different short-comings and benefits. Previous methods have extracted ${\alpha_s}$ by comparing experimental data from deep inelastic scattering,  hadronic ${\tau}$ decays, against predictions from the theory, see \cite{PPB} for an overview. Extractions based on the \textit{R} ratio are of order ${(\alpha_s)^0}$. Expansion of observables which depend on ${\alpha_s}$ start at next-to leading order, ${(\alpha_s)^1}$, and use data from 3-jet rates and event shapes at ${e^+e^-}$. At hadron colliders the ratio of three to two jet production \cite{2to3} and the transfer energy-energy correlation \cite{en2en} starts at order ${(\alpha_s)^1}$ also. To start expansion at ${(\alpha_s)^2}$ inclusive jet cross sections are used \cite{inc}. The observables with the highest sensitivity used so far, whose expansion starts at order ${(\alpha_s)^3}$ are  the five-jet production rates at LEP \cite{LEP}, the heavy quarkonia hadronic decay width \cite{HAD} and the 3-jet inclusive observables \cite{3jet}. These methods have different levels of sensitivity which depends on where the expansion of ${\alpha_s}$ starts. It is usually the case that observables with a lower sensitivity to ${\alpha_s}$ can be measured more precisely than those with a higher sensitivity. \cite{DMP}. A visual comparison of different experimental techniques and their data is given in figure (\ref{allas}), the technique presented in this paper is labelled ${p\bar{p} \rightarrow \text{jets (NLO)}}$.

\section{Background and Theory} 

QCD is a non-abelian i.e. non commutative, gauge field theory; the field is defined such that the transformation rules are only defined locally. A unitary matrix is a matrix whose transpose is the same as its' inverse \cite{BOOK}. QCD describes the strong interaction and is described by the ${SU(3)}$ part of the ${SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)}$ Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) \cite{PPB}. The SM is well-tested and one of the most predictive theories in the history of physics. However it is not complete as it fails to explain the existence of dark matter and dark energy. This is why measurements of constants is  key as in order to determine any discrepancies from the SM an accurate and well established knowledge of fundamental constants is required \cite{PHD}. The special unitary group ${SU(3)}$  means that the representation of the group consists of unitary 3x3 matrices with determinant 1 \cite{GROUP}.  Whilst the ${SU(2) \times U(1)}$ part corresponds to the electroweak sector, whose interactions of the  ${W^\pm}$ and ${Z}$ boson are mediated by the Higgs boson through electroweak symmetry breaking. These give rise to electromagnetism, which is described by quantum electrodynamics (QED) whose field is mediated by photons ${\mathcal{A}^\mu}$ and radioactive decay \cite{PHD}. The Lagrangian of QCD is: \begin{equation} \label{Lag} \mathcal{L} = \sum_ {q} \overline{\psi}_{q,a} (i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \delta_{ab} - g_s \gamma^\mu t_{ab}^C \mathcal{A}_\mu^C  - m_q\delta_{ab})\psi_{q,b} - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^A F^{A \mu\nu}, \end{equation} where the Einstein Summation Convention has been used. The colour-indices, $a,b$, run from 1 to  ${N_c = 3}$, ${m_q}$ represents the mass of the quarks and ${q}$ represents the quark flavour of the spinor $\psi_{q,a}$. Quarks are the fundamental representation i.e. an irreducible representation, of the ${SU(3)}$ group, and the interaction between a quark and anti-quark is given by the first term of equation (\ref{Lag}) . The ${A_\mu^C}$ represents the gluon fields which mediate the strong interaction,  just as ${A_\mu}$ represents the photon field in electrodynamics,. ${C}$ runs from 1 to ${N_c^2 -1 = 8}$, implying that there are 8 types of gluon, which are massless. The ${t_{ab}^C}$ are the generators of the SU(3) group and are eight 3x3 matrices. When a quark and gluon interact, represented by the second term in equation (\ref{Lag}) the quark's colour is "rotated" in ${SU(3)}$ colour space, analogous to an object rotating in physical space, and it's rotation being described by a rotation matrix. This results in the colour charge being transferred from the quark to gluon and vice versa, depending on the interaction. The QCD coupling constant is given the symbol ${g_s}$, which relates to ${\alpha_s}$ via: ${\alpha_s = \frac{g_s^2}{4\pi}.}$ The field tensor ${F_{\mu\nu}^A}$, describes how the gluon field propagates, and is defined: \begin{equation}F_{\mu\nu}^A  = \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_\nu^A  - \partial_\nu \mathcal{A}_\mu^A - g_s f_{ABC} \mathcal{A}_\mu^B \mathcal{A}_\nu^C  \qquad [t^A,t^B] = if_{ABC}t^C,  \end{equation} where ${f_{ABC}}$ are the structure constants of the ${SU(3)}$ group, an example of which is the Levi-Civita symbol \cite{PPB}.

A coupling constant determines how strong an interaction between two particles is when compared to the kinetic terms, which are all terms but the mass term within the Lagrangian i.e. equation (\ref{Lag}). The strong coupling constant ${\alpha _s}$ is not constant and varies at different energy scales, thus we re-name it the running coupling constant \cite{BOOK}. For low energy scales ${\alpha _s}$ is large and forces quarks to bind forming hadrons where perturbation theory cannot be used. For high energy scales ${\alpha _s}$ is small and thus quarks can interact with each other via scattering or annihilation to create new particles, and thus perturbation theory is valid. This is known as asymptotic freedom, as shown in figure \ref{allas}. Thus the strong force binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons in ordinary matter, and also binds nucleons together to form nuclei. ${\alpha _s}$ is said to be strong as it is of higher order than the magnitude of the electric charge, this leads to the hadronic theory of strong interactions thus non-perturbative methods have to be used, for low energy processes. The strong force is mediated by gluons just as the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons and the gluons carry a colour charge, similarly to the electric charge. There are three values of colour charge. Colour charge cannot be directly measured due to asymptotic freedom, i.e. one cannot measure quarks directly, and all hadrons are colour neutral. The need for colour charge can be explained by considering the ${\Delta^{++}}$ baryon which consists of three up quarks (uuu). As the baryon is formed of three identical fermions the overall wave-function needs to be anti-symmetric under exchange of two fermions, according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. However the spin, parity and spatial parts of the wave-function are all symmetric under exchange of two fermions (as they are identical fermions), thus an additional anti-symmetric quantum number is needed, which we denote as colour charge \cite{BOOK}.  


In a collision of fermions there is a scattering centre of high energy and as particles propagate away from the centre they lose energy thus ${\alpha _s}$ increases and binds quarks together, known as hadrons. The number of groups of hadrons that are created outside of the centre is the number of jets, thus as the number of jets increase their likelihood decreases, because more energy is required to create more jets. Particles are always grouped into hadrons as a property of the strong force is that overall stable matter must be colour neutral - this is known as colour confinement \cite{BOOK}. Colour confinement occurs because the strong interaction does not decrease with distance, in fact it is postulated to increase. This means that by the time the separation of quarks is at an observable scale the energy of that separation is so great that it has surpassed the energy needed to create a hadron, hence quarks are never directly observed. Thus we can only directly measure hadrons and not their constituents, partons, so we must include a correction to the cross-section that signifies the correspondence between hadronic and partonic level \cite{DMP}. At parton level ${\alpha _s}$  is small so perturbation theory is valid, whereas at hadron level ${\alpha _s}$  is larger, due to asymptotic freedom, so we must consider non-perturbative effects, hence a correction term is required. For small values of transverse momentum, ${p_T}$, the correction is approximately 10\% and vanishes for large values of ${p_T}$ \cite{HEPP}. This is expected as large ${p_T}$ corresponds to large energy which means ${\alpha_s}$ is small so non-perturbative effects can be ignored, i.e. it is more similar to parton level. This introduces a total systematic uncertainty of 2\% for the correction to the prediction \cite{HEPP}. 

In this paper the process considered is the Drell-Yan process, where-in a quark of one hadron and an anti-quark of another hadron annihilate \cite{BOOK}, this is summarised as: \begin{equation} pp \xrightarrow{Z}  l^+l^- + X, \end{equation} where ${X}$ can be anything, and the ${Z}$ boson is the propagator. In the lowest energy process just the lepton pair ${(l^+l^-)}$ is created, at higher energies the ${X}$ equates to more and more jets of hadrons. These jets are  created from a gluon emission that decays into hadrons. The Drell-Yan process is interesting as, to leading order in QCD, the cross section required ${\sigma(q\bar{q} \rightarrow l^+l^-)}$ is related to the more simple Quantum Electrodynamic (QED) cross section ${\sigma(e^+e^- \rightarrow q \bar{q})}$. However as quarks are coloured we must average over the colour orientations of the quark and anti-quark, which gives an extra factor of ${\frac{1}{3}}$. This means the cross-section is given by: \begin{equation} \label{cross} \sigma(q_f\bar{q_f} \xrightarrow{Z} l^+l^-) = \frac{1}{3}Q_f^2 \dfrac{4\pi\alpha^2}{3\hat{s}}, \end{equation} where ${f}$ subscript represents the quark flavours, ${Q_f}$ represents the electric charge of that quark and ${\hat{s}}$ represents the centre of mass energy. Here ${\alpha = \frac{1}{137}}$ and is denoted the fine structure constant. Equation (\ref{cross}) assumes that the centre of mass energy is high enough to ignore the quark masses \cite{BOOK}. Hence another benefit of a higher centre of mass energy; this approximation becomes more valid, hence reducing the error.

\section{Factorisation and Renormalisation.} 
The cross-section given in equation (\ref{cross}) is only given to leading order and the total-cross section is much more complex and leads to divergences within the matrix element ${\mathcal{M} (pp \rightarrow l^+l^- + X )}$. ${\mathcal{M} (pp \rightarrow l^+l^- + X)}$ gives the amplitude for a given process. There are two types of divergences within ${\mathcal{M} (pp \rightarrow l^+l^- + X)}$: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the ultra-violet (UV) divergences appear due to large loops in the Feynman diagrams which represent the amplitude. These divergences occur when the energy of the interaction becomes arbitrarily large. Here ${\alpha_s}$ is small, so can be treated perturbatively.
	\item the infrared (IR) divergences appear due to i) a virtual or real particle which can reach zero momentum or ii) a massless particle radiated another massless particle, e.g. a gluon can radiate more gluons. These IR divergences occur as energy becomes small and tends to zero. Here ${\alpha_s}$ is large, so must be treated non-perturbatively.
\end{itemize}


The renormalisation scale ${\mu_R}$ is introduced so that the UV divergences are absorbed, thus making the results physically realisable \cite{PHD}. This leads to ${\alpha _s}$ being a function of the unphysical renormalisation ${\mu_R^2}$, which is often taken as the transverse momentum transfer ${p_T^i}$ for a given process, which is defined in section \ref{Results}. In QED the coupling constant is naturally defined by on-shell renormalisation. On-shell means that particles satisfy ${E^2 = p^2 + m^2}$, and that the particles are external lines on a Feynman diagram and that they are real particles. In QCD quarks are strongly interacting particles so they are not directly measurable, and hence are never on the exterior of a Feynman diagram, so we avoid discussing on-shell quarks. This means that we use this arbitrary scale method. 

The IR divergences cancel out in case (i) as predicted by the Kinoshita-Lee-Naunberg Theorem given here \cite{KNL}. The divergences do not cancel out in case (ii), hence a factorisation scale ${\mu_F}$ needs to be introduced. The parton distribution functions become functions of ${\mu_F}$. The Factorisation scale essentially determines the "cut off point" between when perturbation theory is applicable and when it is not. This is because for higher energy ${\alpha _s}$ is small (perturbative) and for low energy, when IR divergences occur, ${\alpha _s}$ is large due to asymptotic freedom as described above \cite{DMP}. For different factorisation scales one can calculate ${\alpha _s}$ and the differences at these varying scales indicates the importance of those higher order terms not included in the summation.
 
Due to asymptotic freedom both types of divergences are encountered in QCD interactions, hence both scales are required. The scales, ${\mu_F}$ and ${\mu_R}$ are arbitrary parameters and physical observables should not depend on them.  However when approximations are made, for example when a summation contains an infinite number of terms and not all the terms are included, the scales become relevant \cite{PHD}. At leading-order the observables, ${\mathcal{O}}$, are monotonous functions of both scales \cite{BOOK}. The effect of changing scale ${\mu_R}$ or ${\mu_F}$ is only present in the next-leading order (NLO) of ${\alpha _s}$. We can take ${\mu_F = \mu_R = \mu_0}$, and define ${\mu_0}$ in terms of the mass ${M_Z}$ of the ${Z}$ boson and the jet transverse momenta ${p_T^i}$: \begin{equation} \label{mu} \mu_0 = \dfrac{\hat{H'}_T}{2}, \qquad \hat{H'}_T = \sum_i p_T^i + E_T^Z, \qquad E_T^Z = \sqrt{M_Z^2 + (p_T^Z)^2}, \end{equation} where ${i}$ indicates all the partons in the final state \cite{DMP}. Equation (\ref{mu}) defines the central scale ${\mu_0}$, the factorisation and renormalisation scales were modified from this central scale to obtain new predictions. The scales were modified from the central scale by factors ${f_\mu^F,f_\mu^R = \frac{1}{2},1,2}$. The differences between the predictions at each scale combination is then compared in an attempt to eliminate scale uncertainty. For the cross-section of ${Z}$-boson production with at least 1 to 4 jets the uncertainties of the scale ranges from 0.1\% to 10\% \cite{HEPP}. 
 
 

\section{Statistical Analysis and Extraction Procedure.} \label{stats}

For each number of jets, inclusive, the experimental data ${\bold{y_d}}$ is separated into ranges of values of momentum called `bins', more information on the results and experimental data can be found in section (\ref{Results}). In order to obtain a value of ${\alpha_s}$ the ${\chi^2}$ function must be minimised, a ${\chi^2}$ test shows the `goodness of fit' and determines the difference between experimental data and the theoretical predictions \cite{STAT}. When ${\chi^2}$ is minimised this is when the theory matches the experiment the most and hence corresponds to the best value of ${\alpha_s}$, which is denoted ${\alpha_0}$. ${\chi^2}$  is defined:  \begin{equation} \chi^2(\alpha_s(M_z)) = (\bold{y_t}(\alpha_s(M_z))-\bold{y_d})^T\hat{C^{-1}}(\bold{y_t}(\alpha_s(M_z))-\bold{y_d}), \end{equation} where ${\bold{y_t}}$ are the predicted values of the cross section in the bin from the theory. Covariance measures how changes of one variable are associated with another. Thus for example if two variables are completely independent then their covariance matrix is represented as a ${2\times2}$ matrix that is diagonal whose elements are the errors of the associated variables squared. Hence if there are ${n}$ variables then the covariance matrix will be an ${n\times n}$ matrix, where each element has the dimensions of ${error^2}$. The covariance matrix is calculated from the errors of different parts of the extraction and is defined \begin{equation} C = C_{exp} + C_{PDF} + C_{theory}. \end{equation} Each of these covariance matrices are calculated in different ways depending on their definition, ${C_{exp}}$ is the experiments error matrix, ${C_{PDF}}$ is the error associated with fitting a PDF to the data, and ${C_{theory}}$ is the error based on theoretical predictions \cite{DMP}. 

The experimental error is composed of three sources: statistical, luminosity, and systematic, which are all added together in quadrature. The statistical error source  is fundamental to each measurement and is uncorrelated, hence the statistical component of the ${C_{exp}}$ matrix is diagonal and its elements are the statistical errors squared for each momentum bin \cite{DMP}. Luminosity describes how many particles there are in a given space in a given time: a higher luminosity means that particles are more likely to collide. The integrated luminosity was used, which is defined as the maximum luminosity and is the instantaneous number of interactions per second. A collider's aim is to optimise the integrated luminosity \cite{LUM}. The cross sections had a common uncertainty of 2.1 \% from the measurement of the integrated luminosity. The data generated at CERN had a total integrated luminosity of ${3.16   fb^{-1}}$ \cite{HEPP}. The systematic error is reducible and is introduced due to imprecision of instruments, or measurement process. The systematic and luminosity errors are overall essentially constant, when given as the actual error rather than the percentage error of the measurement. The systematic and luminosity errors are assumed to have "upward variation" for each source \cite{HEPD}. This means that the systematic and luminosity component of  ${C_{exp}}$, ${C}$, is calculated via: \begin{equation} \label{Cov} C_{ij}^{A} =  error^{A}_{i} \times error^{A}_{j}, \end{equation} where the ${^A}$ index indicates the type of systematic or luminosity error. Then each ${C_{ij}^{A}}$ are added together, this is then added to ${C_{exp}^{stat}}$ to form the full ${C_{exp}}$.

The PDF's used for this extraction were CT10nlo \cite{CT10}, CT14nlo \cite{CT14}, MSTW \cite{MSTW}, MMHT \cite{MMHT1, MMHT2}, NNPDF2.3 \cite{NN23}, NNPDF3.0 \cite{NN30}. All pdf sets were taken from LHAPDF \cite{LHAPDF}. The cross sections for each bin for the theoretical data, ${\bold{y_t}(\alpha_s(M_z))}$, was generated for each pdf at each value of ${\alpha_s}$ at each factorisation and renormalisation scale using FASTNLO tables \cite{FAST}. The ${C_{PDF}}$ was calculated in two different ways for the two different types of PDF. One type was the `NN' PDF's which are neural network PDF's which means they contain 100 replicas \cite{NN23}.  This means there are 100 PDF sets for each value of ${\alpha_s}$. The values ${\alpha_s}$ for NNPDF2.3 are 0.114-0.124, and for NNPDF3.0 are 0.115, 0.117, 0.118, 0.119, 0.121.  For the NN pdf sets the average value of the cross section, and the standard deviation of each replica from this average was calculated. The ${C_{PDF}}$ matrix was then calculated using equation (\ref{Cov}) where the errors are the standard deviations.

For the other types of PDF there is a central value of ${\alpha_s}$ which is treated separately to the other values of ${\alpha_s}$, this is denoted ${\alpha_0}$ . At ${\alpha_0}$, the proton is described by many PDF sets, one of which is the best fit to the physical situation considered, this is denoted ${f^0}$. This  ${f^0}$ is composed of many different parameters which can all be varied. The other PDF's which also parameterise the proton are presented in pairs ${f^{k \pm}}$ where one of the parameters has been varied from ${f^0}$. These ${f^{k \pm}}$ are said to parameterise the 1${\sigma}$ variation of the ${k^{th}}$ fit parameter. These ${f^{k \pm}}$ results in an asymmetric PDF error \cite{CPDF}. The ${C_{PDF}}$ for  ${\alpha_0}$ is calculated first. Initially the asymmetric error for each momentum bin is calculated using: \begin{equation} \Delta\sigma^+_{PDF} = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1,n_{PDF}} {\max(0, +\sigma_{k,+} - \sigma_0, +\sigma_{k,-} -\sigma_0)^2}}, \end{equation}  \begin{equation} \Delta\sigma^-_{PDF} = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1,n_{PDF}} {\min(0, -\sigma_{k,+} + \sigma_0, -\sigma_{k,-} +\sigma_0)^2}}. \end{equation} Here the ${\sigma_{k,\pm}}$ represents the cross sections calculated for each bin from the ${f^{k \pm}}$ pairs. The  ${\Delta\sigma^\pm_{PDF}}$ represents the asymmetric errors ${\pm}$ of the true value, the total error is found by averaging the two errors for each bin value. The errors are then converted to a covariance matrix for each PDF by using equation (\ref{Cov}). The other values of ${\alpha_s}$ are described by only one PDF which has the same values of parameters as ${f^0}$, so ${C_{PDF}(\alpha_s)}$ is calculated using ${C_{PDF}(\alpha_0)}$. The ${C_{PDF}(\alpha_0)}$ matrix was converted to a percentage error matrix, rather than an actual error matrix using: \begin{equation} \label{PERREV} C_{\%} = \dfrac{C_{PDF}^{i,j}(\alpha_0) \times 100}{ \sigma_{0}^{i} \times  \sigma_{0}^{j}}, \end{equation} where ${\sigma_0^j}$ are the cross section values for bin ${j}$. This ${C_{\%}}$ was then used for each type of PDF in equation (\ref{PERREV}). Where the values of ${\sigma_{0}}$ are now generated from PDF's where ${\alpha_s}$ is not equal to ${\alpha_0}$. The effects of PDF uncertainties range from 1\% to 4\% for the cross-sections of ${Z}$-boson production and are included in the predictions made from BLACKHAT+SHERPA \cite{HEPP}.

Firstly, figure \ref{SCAT} shows the physical scattering set up, and how angles are defined. A useful quantity to now define is the rapidity, ${\eta = -\ln[\frac{\tan{\theta}}{2}]}$. From this we can now define a useful co-ordinate system, ``${\eta-\phi}$'' space, where-in the direction of an outgoing jet is represented by a point in ${\eta-\phi}$ space. The size of a jet can be defined as the radius, $R$, in ${\eta-\phi}$ space that contains 80\% of the transverse jet momentum ${p_T}$. The cross section is measured for a given range of transverse momentum ${p_T}$, and the cross section are put into a `bin' corresponding to this range. ${p_T}$ is a fundamental observable of the jet process and probes QCD over a wide range of scales \cite{HEPP}. Figure (\ref{xsection}) shows that predictions from BLACKHAT+SHERPA are in agreement with the measured cross section within the systematic uncertainties over the full leading jet ${p_T}$ range. Hence it is appropriate to use PDF's generated using BLACKHAT+SHERPA, for the full range of ${p_T}$, to calculate ${\alpha_s}$. Figure (\ref{xsection}) also shows that the total experimental uncertainty is largely composed of statistical uncertainty for ${p_T = 300-700}$ [GeV], but the statistical uncertainties contribution to the total uncertainty is much smaller for lower values of ${p_T}$. This is because the systematic and luminosity uncertainties are essentially constant for all measurements, as discussed in section (\ref{stats}), but the actual statistical error increases due to there being less scattering events, thus there is less data as the measured cross section has decreased \cite{HEPD}. This is evident in figure (\ref{xsection}). Understanding the origin of the errors is fundamental to a useful extraction of ${\alpha_s}$.
